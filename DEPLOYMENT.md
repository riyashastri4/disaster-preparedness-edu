## 🚀 Render.com Deployment Steps

### 1. Automatic Deployment
Since you're using Render.com with GitHub integration, your app should automatically deploy from the latest commit.

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Go to your Render.com dashboard and add/update these environment variables:

```env
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-here
NODE_ENV=production
```

⚠️ **Important**: Generate a secure random string for `SESSION_SECRET`. You can use:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
1. Wait for Render.com to complete the build and deployment
2. Visit your site: https://disaster-preparedness-edu-1.onrender.com/
3. Test the new authentication:
   - Click "Sign Up" button
   - Try creating an account with email/password
   - Test login functionality
   - Verify user name appears in navigation after login
   - Test logout functionality
