# Email Authentication Setup Instructions

## 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the authentication dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Configure Environment Variables
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Fill in your values in the `.env` file:
   ```env
   SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-change-this-in-production
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

## 3. For Render.com Deployment
1. In your Render.com dashboard, go to your web service settings
2. Add the following environment variables:
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: A random secret key (generate one securely)
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`

## 4. Test the Authentication
1. Start your local server: `npm start`
2. Click the "Sign Up" button
3. Test email signup and login functionality
4. Verify that user sessions persist across page refreshes
5. Test logout functionality

## What's Changed

### ✅ Removed
- Old "Create Account" button text
- Simple signup modal

### ✅ Added  
- **Sign Up/Login toggle** in the modal
- **User profile display** in navigation
- **Session management** with Express sessions
- **Secure password hashing** with bcrypt
- **Auto-login** after successful email signup
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices

### New Features
1. **Email Authentication**: Username/password signup and login
2. **User Sessions**: Persistent login across browser sessions
3. **Profile Display**: Shows user name in navigation
4. **Secure Logout**: Proper session cleanup

## Security Features
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- Sessions use secure cookies in production
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- Session-based authentication

## How It Works

### Sign Up Process
1. User enters username, email, and password
2. Password is hashed with bcrypt
3. User is stored in memory
4. Session is created automatically
5. User is logged in immediately

### Login Process
1. User enters email and password
2. System finds user by email
3. Password is verified against hash
4. Session is created for authenticated user
5. User profile is displayed in navigation

### Session Management
- Sessions persist until logout or server restart
- User stays logged in across page refreshes
- Logout destroys the session completely

## Need Help?
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the server console for error messages
2. Ensure environment variables are correctly set
3. Test locally before deploying to Render.com
4. Verify that SESSION_SECRET is set properly
